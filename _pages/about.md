I'm a postdoctoral researcher at the [Australian Institute for Machine Learning](https://www.adelaide.edu.au/aiml), the [University of Adelaide](https://www.adelaide.edu.au). My supervisor is [Tat-Jun Chin](https://cs.adelaide.edu.au/~ssl/author/tat-jun-chin/).

The title of my PhD thesis is "Mathematical optimisation for vision-based problems in [space domain awareness](https://www.marcusholzinger.com/space-situational-or-domain-awareness-know-the-difference/)", which is the shortest TL;DR about my recent research activities. 

Previously, I've worked on [scene text detection](https://paperswithcode.com/task/scene-text-detection) and [simultaneous localisation and mapping (SLAM)](https://paperswithcode.com/task/simultaneous-localization-and-mapping) problems. Currently, I'm interested in vision-related space problems, i.e., [AI4SPACE](https://aiforspace.github.io/2024/).

My Google Scholar is [here](https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=ca90ZhoAAAAJ&hl=en).

Reach me at the conventional name arrangement dot 'pro' at the search engine with the RGBY colourway.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
