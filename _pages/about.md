I'm a (very-soon-to-be-graduated) computer science PhD candidate at the [University of Adelaide](https://www.adelaide.edu.au). I'm also affliated with [Australian Institute for Machine Learning (AIML)](https://www.adelaide.edu.au/aiml). 

The title of my PhD thesis is "Mathematical optimisation for vision-based problems in [space domain awareness](https://www.marcusholzinger.com/space-situational-or-domain-awareness-know-the-difference/)", which is the shortest TL;DR about my recent research activities. 

Previously, I've worked on the [scene text detection](https://paperswithcode.com/task/scene-text-detection) and [simultaneously localisation and mapping (SLAM)](https://paperswithcode.com/task/simultaneous-localization-and-mapping) problems. Currently, I'm interested in vision-related space and (more generally) computer vision problems, primarily leveraging optimisation-based and deep learning methods.
