I'm a (very-soon-to-be-graduated) computer science PhD candidate at the [University of Adelaide](https://www.adelaide.edu.au). My supervisor is [Tat-Jun Chin](https://cs.adelaide.edu.au/~ssl/author/tat-jun-chin/). I'm also affliated with [Australian Institute for Machine Learning (AIML)](https://www.adelaide.edu.au/aiml). 

The title of my PhD thesis is "Mathematical optimisation for vision-based problems in [space domain awareness](https://www.marcusholzinger.com/space-situational-or-domain-awareness-know-the-difference/)", which is the shortest TL;DR about my recent research activities. 

Previously, I've worked on the [scene text detection](https://paperswithcode.com/task/scene-text-detection) and [simultaneously localisation and mapping (SLAM)](https://paperswithcode.com/task/simultaneous-localization-and-mapping) problems. Currently, I'm interested in vision-related space and (more generally) computer vision problems, primarily leveraging optimisation-based and deep learning methods.

My Google scholar is [here](https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=ca90ZhoAAAAJ&hl=en).

Reach me at the conventional name arrangement dot 'pro' at the search engine with the RGBY colourway.

Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
